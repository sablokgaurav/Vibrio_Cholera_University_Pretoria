# vibrio_cholera_package
This git contains the genome analysis class for the vibrio chlorea class which can perform all analysis on virbio genomes. \
There is a recent outbreak of chlorea in South africa and potentially new genomes from these samples are going to be seqeunced. \
This git contains a model estimation class for the vibrio genomes and applies model based learning to predict the variables. \
A vibrio clorela class that will read the genome and give you all the features, it will perform the IP and geographical \
localization of the sample collection sites, will estimate the coordinates, if you want to train the environmental \
variables then it will train, if you want to train the sequences then it will train. It will prepare all the graphs and the maps. \
All the functions are independent of each other and compiled into a final package for the release. It also contains the functions for the 
odd ratio analysis and also for the gene expression machine learning based on the mix model.
