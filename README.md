# vibrio_cholera_class
This git contains the genome analysis class for the vibrio chlorea class which can perform all analysis on virbio genomes. There is a recent outbreak of chlorea in South africa and potentially new genomes from these samples are going to be seqeunced. This git contains a model estimation class for the vibrio genomes and applies model based learning to predict the variables. A vibrio clorela class that will read the genome and give you all the features, it will perform the IP and geographical localization of the sample collection sites, will estimate the coordinates, if you want to train the environmental variables then it will train, if you want to train the sequences then it will train. It will prepare all the graphs and the maps.
